In our hyperconnected world where everyone is constantly *buzzing* with stress, anxiety, and digital overwhelm, I witnessed a paradox: we have endless wellness content, yet people feel more disconnected from inner peace than ever.

The catalyst moment came during finals week when I saw my roommate having a breakdown at 2 AMâ€”anxious, exhausted, desperately searching for relief but finding only generic meditation apps with robotic voices and cookie-cutter solutions that felt distant and unhelpful.

That night, a question ignited in my mind: *"What if we could spark that inner flame of zen and unleash the serenity already within us?"*

Traditional meditation apps treat everyone the same. But our struggles are unique, our stress triggers are personal, and our path to peace is individual. Bliss Buzz was born from this realizationâ€”to create an *intelligent companion* that doesn't just play meditation tracks, but truly understands you, adapts to your emotional state, and *ignites transformation* from chaos to calm.

The name embodies our philosophy: taking the frantic "buzz" of modern life and alchemizing it into pure "bliss"â€”because serenity isn't something to chase, it's already within you, waiting to be unleashed.
